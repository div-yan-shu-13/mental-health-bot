## Prerequisites
1. GitHub account with your code
2. Railway account (free at railway.app)
3. $5 monthly credit (free tier)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code
1. Push all changes to GitHub
2. Ensure gunicorn is in requirements.txt
3. Ensure your app has a health check endpoint

## Step 2: Deploy Backend
1. Go to railway.app and sign up
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will auto-detect Python and deploy

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In your Railway project dashboard:
- SECRET_KEY: (generate a random string)
- GROQ_API_KEY: (your Groq API key)
- DATABASE_URI: (Railway will provide PostgreSQL)

## Step 4: Deploy Frontend
1. Create a new project for frontend
2. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Set build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Set output directory: `build`

## Step 5: Update Frontend API URL
Update frontend/src/services/api.js:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://your-backend-app.railway.app/api';
```

## Step 6: Test Deployment
1. Test backend: https://your-backend-app.railway.app/api/health
2. Test frontend: https://your-frontend-app.railway.app

## Railway Advantages
- Fast deployments
- Good performance
- Built-in monitoring
- Easy scaling
- $5 free credit monthly

## Troubleshooting
- Check Railway logs in dashboard
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Verify health check endpoint works
- Check build logs for errors

## Why This Combination?
- **Vercel**: Best-in-class React hosting
- **Render**: Great Python backend hosting
- **Both**: Generous free tiers

## Step 1: Deploy Backend on Render
Follow the Render deployment guide first.

## Step 2: Deploy Frontend on Vercel
1. Go to vercel.com and sign up
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect React
5. Set build command: `npm run build`
6. Set output directory: `build`

## Step 3: Update API URL
Update frontend/src/services/api.js:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api';
```

## Step 4: Deploy
Click "Deploy" and wait for build to complete.

## Vercel Advantages
- Instant deployments
- Global CDN
- Automatic HTTPS
- Custom domains
- Great performance
- Zero configuration

## URLs You'll Get
- Backend: https://your-app.onrender.com
- Frontend: https://your-app.vercel.app

## Troubleshooting
- Check Vercel build logs
- Ensure API URL is correct
- Verify CORS is configured
- Test API endpoints
